# File 2-1.py
# Example 2. Simple Calculations with Python

# Importing of whole module and giving alias 'np'
# The alias could be any (short) name you wish
import numpy as np

# or importing one function
from numpy import sin

# Now you can use mathematical functions:
a = sin(1)     # function 
b = np.cos(1)  # function call is: the alias - dot - the name
print(a)
print(b)
