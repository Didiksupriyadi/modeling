# Example 1. Quick Introduction to Python

# Variables definition:
a = 4
b = 4.56
c = 3.4e-1 # =3.4x10^-1 = 0.34

# To show variables content you can use 'print' function:
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# You can also write:
d = 45.23
print( d )

# Spaces in the middle of a line code are not important for python, but
# could make the code more readable by human. Use them.
# Please note! Spaces at THE BEGINNING of a line are VERY IMPORTANT for python
# This issue will be explained later.
